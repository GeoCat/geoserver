# GeoServer Enterprise Documentation



## Sphinx

Documentation is written using the sphinx documentation system using restructured text. Extensive use of directives are used to capture intent (command, menu-selection,gui-label,kbd) rather than marking text in italic or bold.

## Pavement 

Pavement is a python build tool equivalent to make or ant.

* `paver builddocs` generate documentation in `build/html` folder.

For more information please see [geocat-documentation](https://github.com/volaya/geocat-documentation).

## Themes

A number of sphinx themes are available:

* [geocat_sphinx_template](https://eos.geocat.net/gitlab/geocat/geocat_sphinx_template/tree/master) (currently unavailable due to git permission issues)

These themes are managed as git submodules for ease of maintenance.
